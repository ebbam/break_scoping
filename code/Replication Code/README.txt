Instructions how to replicate the main results:

1. Copy all files and folders to a location of your choice.
2. Open “00 Master script.R” in R
3. Install the R packages indicated in lines 4ff. that you have not already installed, except getspanel whose installation we explain in the following step. Use install.packages(“devtools”) to install the R developer tools, too. 
4. You must install package “getspanel” manually. To this end, load library devtools using library(devtools). Afterwards, use devtools::install_github("moritzpschwarz/getspanel@ef5da2a") to install getspanel.
4. Update line 14 of the code to indicate where you copied the data in STEP 1
5. Execute the script
